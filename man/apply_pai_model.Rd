\title{Apply a Trained PAI Model to Correct a Vector Map}
\usage{
apply_pai_model(pai_model, map)
}
\arguments{
\item{pai_model}{An object of class \code{pai_model} returned by \code{train_pai_model()}.}

\item{map}{An \code{sf} object representing the vector map to be corrected.}
}
\value{
A new \code{sf} object with the corrected geometry. Original attributes are
preserved, and an \code{area_new} column is added for polygon features.
}
\description{
Applies a trained \code{pai_model} object to an \code{sf} vector map,
correcting the position of all its vertices based on the learned transformation.
}
\details{
This function is the final step in the PAI workflow. It iterates through
each feature of the input \code{map}, uses a recursive method to handle arbitrarily
complex geometries (e.g., MULTIPOLYGON with holes), predicts the necessary \code{dx}
and \code{dy} correction for each vertex, and then reconstructs the map's geometry
with the corrected coordinates.
