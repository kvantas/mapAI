\title{Perform a Differential Distortion Analysis}
\usage{
analyze_distortion(pai_model, points_to_analyze, reference_scale = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{pai_model}{A model object of class \code{pai_model} from \code{train_pai_model()}.}

\item{points_to_analyze}{An \code{sf} object of \strong{points} where the analysis should be performed.}

\item{reference_scale}{A single numeric value used to normalize the area scale calculation. Defaults to \code{1}.}
}
\value{
An \code{sf} object containing the original points and new columns with all
calculated distortion metrics.
}
\description{
Computes detailed distortion metrics for a PAI model at specified locations.
}
\details{
This function implements a differential analysis based on Tissot's
indicatrix theory... (rest of details section is unchanged)
}
\examples{
# --- 1. Train a GAM model for a rich, spatially varying analysis ---
library(magrittr)
data(gcps)
gam_model <- train_pai_model(gcps, method = "gam")

# --- 2. Analyze distortion on a regular grid of points ---
analysis_points <- sf::st_make_grid(gcps, n = c(20, 20)) \%>\%
sf::st_centroid() \%>\%
  sf::st_sf()

distortion_results <- analyze_distortion(gam_model, analysis_points)

# --- 3. View the new metric columns in the output ---
head(distortion_results)
