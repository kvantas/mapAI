\title{Train a PAI Model}
\usage{
train_pai_model(gcp_data, pai_method, seed = 123, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{gcp_data}{An \code{sf} object of homologous points from \code{read_gcps()}.}

\item{pai_method}{A character string specifying the algorithm. One of:
"lm","tps", "gam", "rf", "svmRadial", "svmLinear", or "helmert".}

\item{seed}{An integer for setting the random seed for reproducibility.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the underlying model fitting
functions (\code{mgcv::gam}, \code{stats::lm}, \code{ranger::ranger}, \code{fields::Tps}, \code{e1071::svm}).}
}
\value{
A trained model object of class \code{pai_model}.
}
\description{
Trains a supervised learning or analytical model to define a
spatial transformation.
}
\details{
This function serves as a factory for creating transformation
models. It supports machine learning methods ("lm", "gam", "rf", "svmRadial", "svmLinear") that learn
the relationship between source coordinates and displacement vectors, as
well as the analytical "helmert" method which solves for a global
similarity transformation.

\strong{Important}: The more flexible machine learning models, \code{gam} and \code{rf},
require a sufficient number of data points to produce stable and reliable
results. This function will prevent training these models with fewer than
60 homologous points to avoid overfitting. If you have a small number of
points, please use the more robust "lm" or "helmert" methods.
