\title{Plot Tissot's Indicatrices of Distortion}
\usage{
plot_indicatrices(
  distortion_sf,
  scale_factor = 1,
  fill_color = "lightblue",
  border_color = "black"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{distortion_sf}{An \code{sf} object of \strong{points} returned by \code{analyze_distortion()}.
It must contain the columns \code{a}, \code{b}, and \code{theta_a}.}

\item{scale_factor}{A numeric value to control the size of the plotted ellipses
for better visibility. You will need to adjust this based on your map's scale.}

\item{fill_color}{A character string specifying the fill color of the ellipses.}

\item{border_color}{A character string specifying the border color of the ellipses.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object containing the distortion ellipses plotted in the
source coordinate space.
}
\description{
Visualizes distortion by drawing Tissot's indicatrices (ellipses)
at their original source locations.
}
\details{
This function creates a powerful visual representation of distortion, following
the methodology of Boùùaert et al. (2016). It takes the results from
\code{analyze_distortion()} and draws an ellipse at each analyzed point, centered
on its \strong{source coordinate}. This allows for a direct visual assessment of
distortion on the historical map's geographic space.

Each ellipse graphically shows the magnitude and direction of distortion at that
location:
\itemize{
\item The \strong{shape} of the ellipse shows the angular distortion (shear).
\item The \strong{size} of the ellipse shows the areal distortion.
\item The \strong{orientation} of the ellipse shows the direction of maximum scale.
}
}
\examples{
# --- 1. Train a model and analyze distortion ---
data(gcps)
gam_model <- train_pai_model(gcps, method = "gam")
distortion_at_gcps <- analyze_distortion(gam_model, gcps)

# --- 2. Plot the indicatrices ---
# Note that the pai_model is no longer needed. The function plots the
# distortion centered on the source locations from the distortion_sf object.
# The scale_factor needs to be large enough to make the ellipses visible.
plot_indicatrices(
  distortion_sf = distortion_at_gcps,
  scale_factor = 20
)
