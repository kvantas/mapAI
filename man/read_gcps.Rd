\title{Read and Prepare Homologous Points (GCPs)}
\usage{
read_gcps(gcp_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{gcp_path}{A character string specifying the path with the file name
to the CSV file of homologous points.}
}
\value{
An \code{sf} object of the homologous points, with point geometries based
on the source coordinates and calculated \code{dx} and \code{dy} displacement
columns.
}
\description{
Reads a CSV file containing homologous points and prepares them
for modeling by calculating displacement vectors and creating an \code{sf}
object.
}
\details{
This function is the first step in the modeling workflow. It
requires a CSV file with four specific columns: \code{source_x} and \code{source_y}
(coordinates from the old/distorted map) and \code{target_x} and \code{target_y}
(coordinates from the reference/true map). It calculates the \code{dx} and \code{dy}
errors that the models will learn to predict.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# First, create a demo CSV file
demo_files <- create_demo_data()

# Read the GCPs
gcp_data <- read_gcps(gcp_path = demo_files$gcp_path)

# The output is now ready for model training
print(gcp_data)
}
}
