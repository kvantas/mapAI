\title{mapAI: Positional Accuracy Improvement for Historical Maps}
\description{
The \code{mapAI} package provides a cohesive, end-to-end toolkit in R
for the Positional Accuracy Improvement (PAI) and distortion analysis of
historical vector maps. It uses a suite of statistical and machine learning
models to learn the complex geometric distortions inherent in historical
cartographic documents and applies a correction to use in modern GIS
applications.
}
\details{
The package is designed for researchers and practitioners in
geomatics, GIS, and the digital humanities. It provides a complete, modular
workflow that guides the user from data ingestion to final analysis and
visualization.
\subsection{The Core Workflow}{

The main workflow follows a logical sequence:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Data Handling:} Imports spatial data and control points using
\code{read_map()} and \code{read_gcps()}. The package also includes functions to
generate synthetic data (\code{create_demo_data()}) and save results
(\code{write_map()}).
\item \strong{Model Training & Validation:} Train a correction model using
\code{train_pai_model()} with a choice of methods (\code{"helmert"}, \code{"lm"}, \code{"rf"},
\code{"gam"}). Robustly evaluate model performance using spatial cross-validation
with \code{assess_pai_model()}.
\item \strong{Geometric Correction:} Apply the trained model to the full vector map
to get a geometrically corrected version using \code{apply_pai_model()}.
\item \strong{Distortion Analysis & Visualization:} Go beyond correction to quantify
and understand the distortion itself.
\itemize{
\item Use \code{analyze_distortion()} to compute detailed metrics based on
Tissot's indicatrix theory (e.g., areal scale, angular distortion).
\item Use the dedicated plotting functions (\code{plot_displacement()},
\code{plot_residuals()}, \code{plot_distortion_surface()},
\code{plot_indicatrices()}) to create compelling, publication-quality
visualizations of the error and distortion patterns.
